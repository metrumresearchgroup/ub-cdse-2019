# Integrating the R Package mrgsolve With Available Optimization Routines for Parameter Estimation With PK, PK-PD and QSP Models


After a brief introduction to mrgsolve (https://mrgsolve.github.io), we will
discuss concepts and applications for using the package in R to estimate
parameters given a model and data.  We will establish a basic framework for
running optimization in R and work hands-on examples using different optimizers,
including local and global search algorithms. Building on this framework, we
will also illustrate related workflows including local sensitivity analysis and
likelihood profiling. Finally, a simulation-based workflow for generating
virtual populations (parameters) according to the method of Allen et al.
(https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12063) will be demonstrated.
